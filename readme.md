# Manual Installation

- Download files
- Go to `/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates`
  - If the folder does not exist, create it
- On `/File Templates/`:
  - If the directory does not exists, create it
  - Paste the `Module` and `Interactor` Templates

THIS IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY, SO DO AT OWN RISK 😅
- On `/Project Templates/`
  - Paste the `App` template
  
  
# Automatic Installation

I'm still working on the installation script.

``` The usasge is very simple
Just:
- Open terminal
- Navigate to the folder were the templates where downloaded
- Run "sudo swift installation.swift" (without quotes)
- Enjoy 😁
```
